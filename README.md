# Matching-Game-with-Database
This project is a letter-matching game with a database
The matching game is taken from another developer and you can find his/her name in the files. Using Expressjs and Mysql, I created a database that holds the record
of the players of this game. The database contains the records that gives the player name, playing date and the duration the player finish the game.
